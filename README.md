## Chapter 1: Introduction
### Objective
You will create a Forest with a unique personality, goals, and landscape features, as well as define an Enemy. Your Enemy is an unwelcome encroaching culture who desecrates your land. You must push back their advances into your territory and swallow their own using powerful elements and skills. This tug of war is played out in a journal and on a hand-drawn map which you will create. You don't need to be an expert artist to play. There is a brief map-making guide in this book to get you started with what you need.

“I am the Forest” awakens your personal creativity in several ways. First, you get to embody an eternal Forest! Let your imagination run free. Next, you get to creatively interpret the action between your Forest and your Enemy as you struggle througout the Year to control territory. You will journal this action as first-person accounts from the Forest’s perspective and from the changes to the hand-drawn map you make.

The process of discovering something that is uniquely “you” is what this game is all about!

### Materials Needed
* A pencil with an eraser
* A special notebook dedicated to your Forest
* A printed Character Sheet and Landscape Map
* Two six-sided dice (referred to hereafter as 1d6 for one or 2d6 for two)
* One twelve-sided die (referred to hereafter as d12)
* A good instrumental soundtrack (I recommend anything by Jeremy Soule).


### A Note to GM/DM's on Adaption
"I am the Forest" can serve you as a powerful world development tool. Use it to create brand new worlds with rich Nature vs. Civilization themes. Or you may  import your existing lands and run them through a few Years of game time to develop dynamic settings.
### A Note to Veteran TTRPG Players
This game is based off of elements from OSR games which use:

* A set of attributes to represent a player’s strengths and weaknesses.
* Attribute modifiers which add to or subtract from dice rolls.
* Opposed skill checks where two parties roll against each other. The highest roll after all the modifiers are applied wins.

However, "I am the Forest" differs from traditional RPGs in that it is:

* Much more focused in scope and gameplay.
* Uses map-making and journaling as the primary narrative expression.
* Explores long periods of time very quickly (rounds represent entire years).
* It is much more contemplative.

## Chapter 2: Character Creation
This chapter will take you step-by-step to set up your first game. It will cover all of the basics of setting up your first Forest and Enemy, and walk you through a round or Year of play.

You will also see a drawing tutorial on the inside back cover of this book. Take your time to practice these skills, and your love for your Forest will grow deeper.

First, you will create your Forest and a map of your world. Then, you will create your Enemy and prepare for gameplay.

Be sure to set aside about 30 minutes for this process. You will need about 10 minutes for character creation and journaling, as well as 20 minutes for Territory Map creation.

### Step 1: Define Your Forest's Statistics
#### Nature Type
Your Forest is an interconnected web of elements. These elements represent the primal forces which embody your Forest. This web of elements is called the Forest's Nature Types and they exist in four elements.

Wood ­- Represents a Forest's ability to grow and control all manner of flora such as trees, vegetation, roots, vines, grasses, flowers, and the like. Some Forests adept in wood have the ability to speed up and slow down growth, while others are said to be able to create fully conscious plant life.

Water -­ Represents a Forest's ability to control its rivers, springs, lakes and glaciers. All living things depend on clean water. While a Forest naturally nourishes those within its borders, some Forests adept in water have been known to sabotage water sources.

Earth -­ Repersents a Forest's command of the soil, the stone, the hills, mountains, canyons and fault lines. Forests adept in earth can have surprising control over the altitude and density of their lands, creating mudslides or sinkholes when needed.

Air -­ Represents a Forest's ability to control the heavens. Forests adept in air harnass this power to supply gentle rains, but others spin out hurricanes, dust storms, heat, blinding darkness, or even toxic gas.

#### Nature Value
Each Forest contains each of the four Nature Types,
yet each Forest is uniquely gifted in certain Nature Types. Some Forests are excellent at commanding Water to spread yet may be inept at using Earth to grow mountains. The degree to which a Forest is gifted in a particular Nature Type is called the Nature Value.

To determine the unique Nature Values of your Forest, use your two six­sided dice (2d6) and the Character Sheet. Roll 2d6, add their total (between 2 and 12), and write it in the Forest section of the Character Sheet in the Wood Nature Value box. Roll 2d6 again and continue this process for each of the other three Nature Types; Water, Earth, and Air.

#### Nature Potency
Next, you will determine your Forest's Potency.
This represents how powerful the Forest's particular Nature Type is. The higher the Nature Value, the higher the Potency. You will see in CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW that Potency is added to dice rolls to determine whether you are successful or not. Therefore, positive values are an advantage while negative values are a liability.
To fill in the Potency, look at the Nature Value for Wood, and compare it to the Potency Table on the Character Sheet. Write that Potency (between ­2 and +2) next to Wood's Nature Value. Do the same for the rest of the Nature Values.

### Step 2: Define Your Forest's History
Story is an integral part of "I am the Forest." As such, you will piece together what you can uncover about your Forest's past.

To determine your Forest's history, prepare your notebook and d12. Roll on each of the Forest Tables and note down the results. In addition, the Event Tables on the Character Sheet may also be useful. Take time to imagine how all these pieces fit together in a meaningful way, and write down what you have uncovered about your Forest's history. It may help to journal a brief history in first­person perspec­ tive, “I am the Forest...”

# TODO: Consider a bigger section on how to use oracle tables along with an example.

#### New to This Concept?
If you are unfamiliar with the idea of rolling on oracle tables, below are some guidelines.

- The goal is "inspiring idea," not "correct idea." If a roll gives you a great idea, but it doesn't perfectly match the roll, favor the great idea over a literal interpretation.
- Look for unexpected connections. Does your Forest have a low Nature Value for Wood and you rolled "Hated Cateclysm" for history? Maybe a meteor hit the Forest hundreds of years ago, burning the trees to a crisp!
- Reroll if you really draw a blank. Feel free to find another result if you try but can't think of anything.

### Step 3: Define Your Ally
You are not alone in your desire to retake land that your enemy has fouled. Your Ally is bonded to you and comes to your aid when things look dire. Allies are beings or forces which have a symbiotic relationship with the Forest. They provide Ally Abilities which can be summoned in times of need.

#### Select Ally
Roll d12 on the Ally Table. Note your
Ally on your Character Sheet. Alternatively, you may want to read over the list of Allies and select one which resonates with you.

#### Define Ally's History
Your Ally has a history of their own, and has a reason to protect your Forest. The history of this motivation is a fascinating thread to pull.

To determine the event which bound your Ally to you, roll both Event Tables on the Character Sheet. Also roll the Forest Motivation Tables for an in-­depth history. Note the backstory in your journal.

### Step 4: Draw the Starting Landscape
For this step, you really get to embody your Forest. There are several steps you might take to draw the map, but ultimately the process is up to you.
This step is important and should be not be done hastily. Take your time to work, rework, and fall in love with your Forest. The more you invest in each hex, the more invested you will be in the story and the struggle to defend it.

#### Pointers
- Drawing Guide - Reference the drawing guide to practice some landscape features.
- Randomly Roll...or not! -­ Use the Forest Hex Generation Table to determine
what types of features will be located on groups of hexes. Or simply draw what you want!
- Primary Feature -­ Prominently draw your Forest's Primary Feature. It can hold a lot of narrative weight and should be considered the "heart" of your Forest.
- Nature Values -­ Consider your Nature Values when drawing. If you are very high or low in certain Values, incorporate that in your drawings.
- Have Fun ­ Take your time and enjoy this process!

### Step 5: Define the Enemy's Statistics
#### Nature Type
The Enemy has a unique Nature. But unlike your Forest's elemental Nature Types, the Enemy's Nature Types are destructive and corrosive to the Forest. The four Enemy Nature Types are:

Chop -­ Represents the Enemy's aggressiveness with blades. They may use them to fell trees, clear land, fend off dangerous animals, or hunt and butcher wildlife for meat.

Burn -­ Represents the Enemy's mastery of flame. They may simply use it to disrupt the night with light, or use it to slash and burn for crop planting, utilize it for forging, or harness it for powering industry.

Carve -­ Represents the Enemy's adeptness at terraforming the land and using stone. They may strip mine mountains, tunnel deep into the earth, fill canyons, divert or dam up waterways, raise stone edifices, or erect stone fortresses.

Pollute -­ Represents the Enemy's handling of its own waste. Some pollutants are natural byproducts of daily life and industry, while others may be born of fouler arcane experiments. Pollution may be accidental or intentional if a civilization is hostile to the Forest.

#### Nature Value
Your Enemy is strong in some Nature Types and weak in others. Their rating in each of the Nature Types is called the Nature Value.

To determine the unique Nature Values of your Enemy, use 2d6 and the Character Sheet. Roll 2d6, add their total (between 2 and 12), and write it in the Enemy section of the Character Sheet in the Chop Nature Value box. Repeat this for the other three Nature Values.

#### Nature Potency
Next, you will determine your Enemy's Potency. To
fill in the Potency, look at the Nature Value for each of your Enemy's Nature Types, and compare it to the Potency Table on the Character Sheet. Write that Potency (between ­2 and +2) next to its Nature Value.

#### Enemy Culture
Your Enemy has a unique culture which makes them specially adept in certain Nature Types. Roll d12 on the Enemy Culture Table on page 69. Note the Potency bonuses for the culture, and add that bonus to their existing Potency. The Enemy's new Potency is their Nature Value Potency + Culture Potency bonuses.

### Step 6: Define Enemy History
The Enemy has a motivation to threaten your Forest. It may be that they hate the wilds because of a past cultural trauma. Perhaps their religion has a taboo about your Forest's Primary Feature. Or maybe they are simply aggressive colonizers seeking to master the elements. In any case, determining Enemy history and motivation can greatly open up the story of your game.

To determine Enemy history, roll d12 on the Event Tables and the Enemy Motivation Tables on page 70. Think about your results and write down the Enemy history in your journal.

### Step 7: Determine and Draw Enemy Territory
The Enemy invades. Centers of housing, manufacturing, and trade blister the land. Roads slice through virgin wilderness, fences constrict the Forest's creatures, dammed rivers yearn for freedom, and toxified lakes choke on their own waters.

#### Determine Territory
To determine the Enemy's starting territory, you need 2d6 and the Territory Map. Roll 2d6 on top of the map. Where a die lands is called the origin. The number on the die determines how many hexes belong to the Enemy. 

Connect the origins and draw borders to encompas the total number of hexes rolled. 

If your 2d6 roll is less than 5, simply make the total Enemy territory a size of 5.

If a die rolls off the map, consider it as having landed on the hex it is closest to, and draw the territory from there.

If you cannot connect origins with your roll, start over by rerolling both dice until you can.

#### Draw Territory
For each hex in Enemy territory, erase your Forest's features or alter them and redraw the Enemy's structures or effects on the land.

### Step 8: Pick Forest Starting Ability
Abilities offer your Forest a chance to turn the tables on your Enemy. Abilities come in two forms; Forest Abilities which grant a Potency bonus when using a certain Nature Type, and Ally Abilities which cause chaotic effects. The details of how Abilities work are covered in Chapter 5: Abilities. For now, pick one Forest Ability which interests you.

Turn to the Forest Abilities.  Read over the Abilities for each Nature Type. Select a Forest Ability for which your Nature Value is 5 or greater. Consider wether you want to take an ability to boost one of your low Potencies, or to bolster an already strong Potency.Write it on your Character Sheet, circling level 1. You will have chances to gain new abilities and level up your existing ones throughout the game.

### Step 9: Note Ally Starting Ability
While Allies partner with the Forest, they are not directly under the Forest's control. When an Ally assists the Forest, it uses abilities which throw in an element of chaos. Note your Ally’s level 1 Ability on your Character Sheet.

### Step 10: Wrap Up and Begin Gameplay!
Finish the Character Creation sheet by summarizing your Forest, Ally, and Enemy histories and motiva-tions. Name them all if you wish.

Congratulations! You are ready to play.

## Chapter 3: Gameplay Overview
### Goals
Gameplay in "I am the Forest" revolves around attempts by the Enemy to Encroach or advance upon your Forest's territory and your Forest's attemept to Defend, then Encroach upon Enemy Territory over the course of multiple Years. 

Players can win the game by reclaiming every hex on the map, but the beauty of "I am the Forest" is the experience of builing a rich landscape with a tumult-uous history.

GM's should engage with this game as a tool to create their own worlds, or alter an existing one as the people of their world alter the landscape.

### Terminology
#### Encroachment
Encroachment refers to an effort to take over  territory. Both the Forest and the Enemy Encroach upon each other's territory. Though this effort may be intentionally hostile, it may also be a natural consequence of something else.

For example, the Enemy may Encroach on the Forest's woodland because they want to destroy all the threatening animals within, or perhaps they must Encroach on the woodland because their homes were destroyed last Year by the Forest and they need a new place to settle.

#### Valid Hex
Valid Hex means a hex which is able to be Encroached upon because it shares a border with an opposing hex. In the image below, A and B share a border, so A may Encroach on the valid hex B. A may not Encroach on C because they do not share a border.

#### Years
Gameplay is structured into a series of steps which constitute a full round. In "I am the Forest," rounds are counted in Years. Each round represents a full Year's effort by the Enemy and the Forest to Encroach upon and defend territory. You will recount each Year's events in a journal from your Forest's perspective.

### Year Overview
1. Year Begins
    - Ally and Forest Abilities reset
2. Enemy Encroachment
    - Select a Valid Hex: Count valid hexes clockwise using d12 and starting from your topmost vald hex.
    - Roll d12 on Enemy Nature Type
    - Roll Enemy Encroachment Score: 2d6 + Potency 
    - Roll Forest Defense Score: 2d6 + Potency + Ability (if used)
    - Compare Scores to determine who prevailed.
    - Journal the outcome and add Growth Points if Forest Wins.
3. Forest Encroachment
	- Select a Valid Hex: Choose an Enemy Valid Hex.
	- Plan: Pick which Forest Nature Type to Encroach with.
	- Roll Encroachment Score: 2d6 + Potency + Ability (if used).
	- Roll Enemy Defense Type and  Score: d12 for Type and 2d6 + Potency for score.
	- Compare Scores to determine who prevailed.
	- Journal the outcome and add Growth Points (if Forest Wins).
4. Grow Your Forest
    - Apply your Growth points if you wish to make your Forest stronger.
5. Year Ends
    - Make any final journal entries or plans.

## Chapter 4: Gameplay In-Depth
### Phase 1: Year Begins
In this phase, you take stock of the current territory distribution, Forest and Enemy stats, and form a general idea of how you would like the Year to progress.

### Phase 2: Enemy Encroachment
<!-- TODO: Maybe this should be an ordered list 1. 2. 3. instead of #### -->
#### Select a Valid Hex to Encroach on:
- Look at your topmost Valid Hex which shares a border with the Enemy. Roll d12 and count clockwise from here counting only Valid Hexes. Where the count stops is where the Forest hex the Enemy will Encroach upon.

#### Encroach with an Enemy Nature Type: 
Roll d12 to determine which Nature Type the Enemy Encroaches with and which Valid Hex it uses.

#### Roll Enemy Encroachment Score:
Roll 2d6 + Enemy Nature Type Potency. This is the score that the Forest must match or exceed to Defend its territory.

#### Doubles Rule:
If the Encroachment roll turns up doubles (double 1, double 2, etc.), then a random event will happen. Read about this in Chapter 6: Special Rules.

#### Roll Forest Defense Score:
Decide which of your Nature Types you will defend with, and any Forest Ability or Ally Ability you wish to use (you may only use one ability of any kind per Year whether Defending or Encroaching). Roll 2d6 + Potency + Forest Ability Level (if used). 

The defense should make sense to the narrative. For example, if the Enemy Encroaches with Burn by a massive slash and burn campaign, it would not make sense to use Wood to defend. Rather, you might use Water to flood river banks, or Air to cause heavy rains.

#### Determine Winner
Compare Enemy Score and Forest Score totals:
- Enemy Wins: Enemy Encroachment Score is greater than Forest Defense Score. You lose the contested hex to the Enemy. Erase your Forest from that hex, redraw the border and draw in Enemy territory features. Write about the struggle that ensued, how you tried to mount a defense, and why it just wasn’t enough. Be sure to interpret any random events and erase a second hex if the Enemy rolled doubles for their winning score.

- Forest Wins: Enemy Encroachment Score is less than the Forest Defense Score. You successfully defend your territory. Gain +1 Growth Point on your Character Sheet. Do not change the map. Write about the struggle that ensued, how you mounted a defense, and the casualties your Enemy suffered. Interpret any doubles the Enemy rolled in your favor and defend both hexes.

- Tie: Both Scores are equal. You successfully defend your territory, but at great cost. Do not change the map. Write about the vicious struggle that ensued, how you held your enemy at bay, but how much you both suffered. Interpret any doubles the Enemy rolled as affecting both of you.

### Phase 3: Forest Encroachment
#### Select the hex to Encroach upon:
You may Encroach upon any hex you wish, as long as it shares a long edge with one of your own.

#### Encroach with a Forest Nature Type:
Simply decide which Type you wish to Encroach with and imagine the possible narrative outcome.

#### Forest Encroachment Score:
Roll 2d6 + Potency + Forest Ability Level (if used).

#### Doubles Rule:
If the Encroachment roll turns up doubles (double 1, double 2, etc.), then a random event will happen. Read about this in Chapter 6: Special Rules.

#### Enemy Defense Score:
Roll d12 to determine which Nature Type the Enemy defends with. If the result makes no narrative sense even after "thinking outside the box," then you may reroll the d12. Next, roll 2d6 + Potency to get the Enemy Defense Score.

#### Determine Winner:
Compare Forest Score and Enemy Score totals:
- Forest Wins: Forest Encroachment Score is greater than Enemy Defense Score. Gain +1 Growth Point on the Character Sheet. You gain the contested hex From the Enemy. Redraw the border, erase Enemy features and draw in your own features. Write about the struggle and how you overcame. Be sure to interpret any random events and redraw a second hex if you rolled doubles for your winning score.

- Enemy Wins: Forest Encroachment Score is less than the Enemy Defense Score. You failed to defend your territory. No hexes change hands.Write about the struggle that ensued, and how your Enemy beat you back. Interpret any doubles you rolled in Enemy's favor.

- Tie: Both Scores are equal. The Enemy successfully defended its territory, but at great cost. Do not change the map. Write about the vicious struggle that ensued, how you warred, but how much you both suffered. Interpret any doubles you rolled as affecting both of you.

### Phase 4: Grow Your Forest
In this phase, you steer your Forest's growth in specific directions to better deal with your Enemy. Growth is slow and steady, but inevitable.

#### Growth Points
Growth Points (GP) are gained only when your Forest Wins. You gain +1GP for each hex you successfully gain or defend. If you successfully Encroach or Defend two hexes because of a doubles roll, you gain +2GP. 

Growth Points may be spent, saved, or partially spent and saved. But they may only be spent during the Grow Your Forest phase.

#### Spending GP
There are five ways to spend your GP.

1. Raise Forest Nature Value.

   Spend 1 GP for each +1 Nature Value you wish to increase. You may grow multiple at a time, but you may not exceed a Nature Value of 12 for any Nature Type.

2. Raise Ally Ability Level

   Spend 2 GP for each +1 Ally Ability Level raised. You may raise both levels at once if you have all 4 GP. However, you may only ever have one Ally during a game. Additional Allies may not be gained.

3. Raise Forest Ability Level

   Spend 2 GP for each +1 Forest Ability Level raised. You may grow multiple levels at a time if you have the proper GP and Nature Value. Below are the leveling requirements for the Forest Skill Levels.

   - Forest Ability Lv 1: requires Nature Value at 5+
   - Forest Ability Lv 2: requires Nature Value at 9+
   - Forest Ability Lv 3: requires Nature Value at 12

4. Gain a New Forest Ability Type

   Spend 2 GP for each new Forest Ability Type that you take; for example, taking a new Wood Ability for the first time after already having Air Abilities. The new Forest Ability begins at Level 1, and your Nature Value for the Nature Type of the Ability you wish to take must be 5+.

5. Burst Forth to Gain Enemy Hex.

   Spend 4 GP to burst forth in a surprise Encroach-ment which is unchallenged by the Enemy. Your stored energy allows you instantly gain an Enemy's Valid Hex   of your choice. You do not gain a GP for claiming this hex. Make sure you write a journal entry which captures this monumental action!

### Phase 5: Year Ends
Make any final journaling notes or drawings that you feel you need to close out this Year or set up the next. When you are done, proceed again to Phase 1.

Victory is achieved when your Enemy’s final hex has been swallowed by the Forest, or when you feel your story has come to its natural conclusion.

## Chapter 5: Abilities
Abilities give you some advantage when you Encroach or Defend. Forest Abilities add their level to the roll score if that particular Nature Type was used. Ally Abilities offer random re-rolls which can change  outcomes in unpredicatable ways.

Any Ability may be used at any point during an Encroach or Defend phase, but only one Ability may be used per Year regardless of kind or level.

### Forest Abilities
There are twelve Forest Abilities, three for each of the four Nature Types of Wood, Water, Earth, and Air.

Each Ability provides a narrative focus or a motif you can return to during your game. It helps to round out your Forest as a character. The Ability also provides a Potency bonus for its Nature Type when it is used. The bonus it adds to Potency is equal to the Ability's level. So a Wood Ability at level 2 will add +2 to the Wood Potency when the Ability is used.

#### Example of Forest Ability Use
The Enemy encroaches on your lake hex to overfish it with a roll of 6 and a Chop of +2. Their Encroachment Score is 8 (6+2). You Defend with a roll of 7 and a Water Potency of +1 for a total of 8. That is a tie. But you want a win for the GP. So you decide to use your Water Ability "Like Slate" at Lv 1. Take your Defence score and add "Like Slate's" level to it. 8+1 = 9. You win.

#### Wood Abilities
- Stonewood: The wood of your trees is extraordinarily though.
- Conopy of Darkness: Thick branches tower over the land, covering it in shadow.
- Resilience: Any wood removed from the Forest will return to its natural shape, defying domestication.

#### Water Abilities
- Boundless Flow: Banks and shores swell with volumes of water and spill over the land.
- Like Slate: The water begomes rigid and unmoving, nearly impossible to break.
- Curative Curse: Either healing power or crippling poison infuses itself into the waters.

#### Earth Abilities
- Heaven and Hell: Mountains and valleys burst forth to terraform the land.
- Silent Tremor: The earth quakes and fractures on unseen fault lines.
- Oozing Flux: The earth pours forth in gushes of magma, mud, or landslides.

#### Air Abilities
- Pummel Earth: Punish the surface with a deluge of rain, hail, and lighting strikes.
- Howling Breath: Winds, cyclones, tornadoes, and hurricanes blast the landscape.
- Darkest Bane: Obscure vision and cause despair with darkness from clouds, dust, or fog.

### Ally Abilities
Allies come alongside your Forest to Encroach or Defend territory with. Allies exist autonomously from the Forest, so Ally Abilities may be chaotic or unpredicatble, but they have powerful Abilities. Ally Abilities may be used at any time, except for 2nd level Abilities. 

Ally Abilities differ from Forest Abilities in that:
- They affect dice rolls directly by forcing rerolls or removals instead of a flat bonus to the roll.
- The Ally gains new Abilities rather than gaining a Potency bonus equal to the Ability's new level.
- Once an Ally is chosen it may not be revoked. No other Allies may be gained, whereas multiple Forest Abilities of different Types may be acquired.

#### Table of Allies
- 1-3 Flora: A great diversity of plants support you. Deadly vines, poisonous mushrooms, and man-eating plants are just some of your allies.
- 4-6 Fauna: Animals, insects, and bacteria respond to your call for aid. They do your bidding to protect you at all cost.
- 7-9 Archons: These ancient protectors of the Forest and keen warriors desire harmony with nature and they will fight to protect it.
- 10-12 Shaman: The Shaman seamlessly walks between the Forset and the Enemy. At once widl and tame, they respect balance.

<!-- TODO: Clarify that levels 1 and 2 are merely narrative, but level 3 is different for each. -->
#### Flora
Level 1 Harvest of Madness
- Description: The food plants in the Forest put out toxins which makes the Enemy erratic and unpredictable.

- Before any Defense roll, commit to use Faunal Transfiguration. After the Devense roll, remove Nature's lowest die and the Enemy's highest die, then score.

## Chapter 6: Special Rules
### Doubles Rule
<!-- TODO: Reword the doubles rule. It's confusing. Probably also change the order of the 3 things that happen. Hex at stake first and how to determine which. Then roll the narrative part to explaoin what happened.-->
Whenever an Encroachment roll from either side comes up as doubles (1 and 1, 2 and 2, so forth), then three effects happen. These three effects happen even if an Ability creates or negates a double. The Ability's effects and the double's effects are both applied.
- A random event must occur. Roll on the Event Tables on the Character Sheet and interpret their results after the outcome of the Encroachment is known. Interpret the results in favor of the winner, and journal it to move the story forward.
- Two hexes are now at stake. If the Encroacher wins, they take two Valid Hexes (or as near as possible).
- There are now 2GP at stake. If your Forest wins 		when doubles appear, you gain +2GP. 

### Ability Limits
During a Year, only a single Ability of any kind may be used. This one use refreshes at the Year Begins phase. 

For example, if you use an Ally Ability during the Enemy Encroachment phase, you may not use the Ally Ability again until next Year, and you may not use your Forest Ability because the Ally Ability you used counts as your one Ability for the Year.

### 2nd Level Ability Timing
<!-- TODO: Clarify that this is not "before ANY Defense roll" otherwise it would never get used during the Enemy's Defense Roll since the Forest's Defense roll has already happened. It should say something like "before either the Forest or Enemy Defends." Also "a 3 a 6" needs help...that's ugly.-->
The 2nd level Ally Ability requires that you commit to its use before any Defense roll is made. Therefore, you may commit to using it before any Encroachment roll, after any Encroachment roll, but not after any Defense roll.

For example, you Encroach on the Enemy with a roll of 5 and 1 with a Potency of +1 for a total Encroachment Score of 7. The 1 is concerning to you, and you know you want to get rid of it. You consider the Shaman's 2nd level Ability "Faunal Transfiguration," and decide to use it before the Enemy Defense Roll. Now you roll for the Enemy and get a 3 a 6 and and a Potency of +2 for a score of 12 which beats your score of 7.

However, Faunal Transfiguration removes the Enemy's highest die (6) and your lowest (1). The resulting scores are now Forest: 6 against Enemy: 5. Your Forest Wins.
