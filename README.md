## Chapter 1: Introduction
### Objective
You will create a Forest with a unique personality, goals, and landscape features, as well as define an Enemy. Your Enemy is an unwelcome encroaching culture who desecrates your land. You must push back their advances into your territory and swallow their own using powerful elements and skills. This tug of war is played out in a journal and on a hand-drawn map which you will create. You don't need to be an expert artist to play. There is a brief map-making guide in this book to get you started with what you need.

“I am the Forest” awakens your personal creativity in several ways. First, you get to embody an eternal Forest! Let your imagination run free. Next, you get to creatively interpret the action between your Forest and your Enemy as you struggle througout the Year to control territory. You will  journal this action as first-person accounts from the Forest’s perspective and from the changes to the hand-drawn map you make.

The process of discovering something that is uniquely “you” is what this game is all about!

### Materials Needed
* A pencil with an eraser
* A special notebook dedicated to your Forest
* A printed Character Sheet and Landscape Map
* Two six-sided dice (referred to hereafter as 1d6 for one or 2d6 for two)
* One twelve-sided die (referred to hereafter as d12)
* A good instrumental soundtrack (I recommend anything by Jeremy Soule).


### A Note to GM/DM's on Adaption
"I am the Forest" can serve you as a powerful world development tool. Use it to create brand new worlds with rich Nature vs. Civilization themes. Or you may  import your existing lands and run them through a few Years of game time to develop dynamic settings.
### A Note to Veteran TTRPG Players
This game is based off of elements from OSR games which use:

* A set of attributes to represent a player’s strengths and weaknesses.
* Attribute modifiers which add to or subtract from dice rolls.
* Opposed skill checks where two parties roll against each other. The highest roll after all the modifiers are applied wins.

However, "I am the Forest" differs from traditional RPGs in that it is:

* Much more focused in scope and gameplay.
* Uses map-making and journaling as the primary narrative expression.
* Explores long periods of time very quickly (rounds represent entire years).
* It is much more contemplative.

## Chapter 2: Character Creation
This chapter will take you step-by-step to set up your first game. It will cover all of the basics of setting up your first Forest and Enemy, and walk you through a round or Year of play.

You will also see a drawing tutorial on the inside back cover of this book. Take your time to practice these skills, and your love for your Forest will grow deeper.

First, you will create your Forest and a map of your world. Then, you will create your Enemy and prepare for gameplay.

Be sure to set aside about 30 minutes for this process. You will need about 10 minutes for character creation and journaling, as well as 20 minutes for Territory Map creation.

### Step 1: Define Your Forest's Statistics
#### Nature Type
Your Forest is an interconnected web of elements. These elements represent the primal forces which embody your Forest. This web of elements is called the Forest's Nature Types and they exist in four elements.

Wood ­- Represents a Forest's ability to grow and control all manner of flora such as trees, vegetation, roots, vines, grasses, flowers, and the like. Some Forests adept in wood have the ability to speed up and slow down growth, while others are said to be able to create fully conscious plant life.

Water -­ Represents a Forest's ability to control its rivers, springs, lakes and glaciers. All living things depend on clean water. While a Forest naturally nourishes those within its borders, some Forests adept in water have been known to sabotage water sources.

Earth -­ Repersents a Forest's command of the soil, the stone, the hills, mountains, canyons and fault lines. Forests adept in earth can have surprising control over the altitude and density of their lands, creating mudslides or sinkholes when needed.

Air -­ Represents a Forest's ability to control the heavens. Forests adept in air harnass this power to supply gentle rains, but others spin out hurricanes, dust storms, heat, blinding darkness, or even toxic gas.

#### Nature Value
Each Forest contains each of the four Nature Types,
yet each Forest is uniquely gifted in certain Nature Types. Some Forests are excellent at commanding Water to spread yet may be inept at using Earth to grow mountains. The degree to which a Forest is gifted in a particular Nature Type is called the Nature Value.

To determine the unique Nature Values of your Forest, use your two six­sided dice (2d6) and the Character Sheet. Roll 2d6, add their total (between 2 and 12), and write it in the Forest section of the Character Sheet in the Wood Nature Value box. Roll 2d6 again and continue this process for each of the other three Nature Types; Water, Earth, and Air.

#### Nature Potency
Next, you will determine your Forest's Potency.
This represents how powerful the Forest's particular Nature Type is. The higher the Nature Value, the higher the Potency. You will see in CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW that Potency is added to dice rolls to determine whether you are successful or not. Therefore, positive values are an advantage while negative values are a liability.
To fill in the Potency, look at the Nature Value for Wood, and compare it to the Potency Table on the Character Sheet. Write that Potency (between ­2 and +2) next to Wood's Nature Value. Do the same for the rest of the Nature Values.

### Step 2: Define Your Forest's History
Story is an integral part of "I am the Forest." As such, you will piece together what you can uncover about your Forest's past.

To determine your Forest's history, prepare your notebook and d12. Roll on each of the Forest Tables and note down the results. In addition, the Event Tables on the Character Sheet may also be useful. Take time to imagine how all these pieces fit together in a meaningful way, and write down what you have uncovered about your Forest's history. It may help to journal a brief history in first­person perspec­ tive, “I am the Forest...”

# TODO: Consider a bigger section on how to use oracle tables along with an example.

#### New to This Concept?
If you are unfamiliar with the idea of rolling on oracle tables, below are some guidelines.

- The goal is "inspiring idea," not "correct idea." If a roll gives you a great idea, but it doesn't perfectly match the roll, favor the great idea over a literal interpretation.
- Look for unexpected connections. Does your Forest have a low Nature Value for Wood and you rolled "Hated Cateclysm" for history? Maybe a meteor hit the Forest hundreds of years ago, burning the trees to a crisp!
- Reroll if you really draw a blank. Feel free to find another result if you try but can't think of anything.

### Step 3: Define Your Ally
You are not alone in your desire to retake land that your enemy has fouled. Your Ally is bonded to you and comes to your aid when things look dire. Allies are beings or forces which have a symbiotic relationship with the Forest. They provide Ally Abilities which can be summoned in times of need.

#### Select Ally
Roll d12 on the Ally Table. Note your
Ally on your Character Sheet. Alternatively, you may want to read over the list of Allies and select one which resonates with you.

#### Define Ally's History
Your Ally has a history of their own, and has a reason to protect your Forest. The history of this motivation is a fascinating thread to pull.

To determine the event which bound your Ally to you, roll both Event Tables on the Character Sheet. Also roll the Forest Motivation Tables for an in-­depth history. Note the backstory in your journal.

### Step 4: Draw the Starting Landscape
For this step, you really get to embody your Forest. There are several steps you might take to draw the map, but ultimately the process is up to you.
This step is important and should be not be done hastily. Take your time to work, rework, and fall in love with your Forest. The more you invest in each hex, the more invested you will be in the story and the struggle to defend it.

#### Pointers
- Drawing Guide - Reference the drawing guide to practice some landscape features.
- Randomly Roll...or not! -­ Use the Forest Hex Generation Table to determine
what types of features will be located on groups of hexes. Or simply draw what you want!
- Primary Feature -­ Prominently draw your Forest's Primary Feature. It can hold a lot of narrative weight and should be considered the "heart" of your Forest.
- Nature Values -­ Consider your Nature Values when drawing. If you are very high or low in certain Values, incorporate that in your drawings.
- Have Fun ­ Take your time and enjoy this process!

### Step 5: Define the Enemy's Statistics
#### Nature Type
The Enemy has a unique Nature. But unlike your Forest's elemental Nature Types, the Enemy's Nature Types are destructive and corrosive to the Forest. The four Enemy Nature Types are:

Chop -­ Represents the Enemy's aggressiveness with blades. They may use them to fell trees, clear land, fend off dangerous animals, or hunt and butcher wildlife for meat.

Burn -­ Represents the Enemy's mastery of flame. They may simply use it to disrupt the night with light, or use it to slash and burn for crop planting, utilize it for forging, or harness it for powering industry.

Carve -­ Represents the Enemy's adeptness at terraforming the land and using stone. They may strip mine mountains, tunnel deep into the earth, fill canyons, divert or dam up waterways, raise stone edifices, or erect stone fortresses.

Pollute -­ Represents the Enemy's handling of its own waste. Some pollutants are natural byproducts of daily life and industry, while others may be born of fouler arcane experiments. Pollution may be accidental or intentional if a civilization is hostile to the Forest.

#### Nature Value
Your Enemy is strong in some Nature Types and weak in others. Their rating in each of the Nature Types is called the Nature Value.

To determine the unique Nature Values of your Enemy, use 2d6 and the Character Sheet. Roll 2d6, add their total (between 2 and 12), and write it in the Enemy section of the Character Sheet in the Chop Nature Value box. Repeat this for the other three Nature Values.

#### Nature Potency
Next, you will determine your Enemy's Potency. To
fill in the Potency, look at the Nature Value for each of your Enemy's Nature Types, and compare it to the Potency Table on the Character Sheet. Write that Potency (between ­2 and +2) next to its Nature Value.

#### Enemy Culture
Your Enemy has a unique culture which makes them specially adept in certain Nature Types. Roll d12 on the Enemy Culture Table on page 69. Note the Potency bonuses for the culture, and add that bonus to their existing Potency. The Enemy's new Potency is their Nature Value Potency + Culture Potency bonuses.
### Step 6: Define Enemy History
The Enemy has a motivation to threaten your Forest. It may be that they hate the wilds because of a past cultural trauma. Perhaps their religion has a taboo about your Forest's Primary Feature. Or maybe they are simply aggressive colonizers seeking to master the elements. In any case, determining Enemy history and motivation can greatly open up the story of your game.

To determine Enemy history, roll d12 on the Event Tables and the Enemy Motivation Tables on page 70. Think about your results and write down the Enemy history in your journal.
